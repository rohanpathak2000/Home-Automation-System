# Home Automation System
A Home Automation System simulated using Arduino and Tinkercad software. Our model has 2 modes : Automatic and Manual mode. The project uses a IR remote control. The remote control can be used to switch between the automatic mode and the manual mode. <br/>
1. In the automatic mode the light adjusts based on the daylight intensity and the fan speed adjusts according to the temperature of the room. In case there is no one in the room the light and fan are turned off. <br/>
2. In the manual mode the user can use the remote to adjust the fan speed and the light intensity of the bulb manually.

## How to try it out for yourself
Using tinkercad, create the following circuit diagram and paste the code given in "arduino_code.txt" in the code section.
Run the simulation
